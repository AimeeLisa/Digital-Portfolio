**Situation:**
In preparation for work studies in the second semester, we were required to complete Career Counselling lessons and quizzes. These modules covered essential topics related to career development.

**Task:**
Our assignment was to research and reflect on key aspects of career planning, including distinguishing between jobs and careers, tasks and goals, and understanding how to evaluate career choices based on factors like work environment, salary, and personal interests.

**Action:**
Through these lessons, I learned:

Job vs. Career: A job is a short-term role for earning income, while a career is a long-term pursuit aligned with oneâ€™s skills and interests.
Task vs. Goal: A task is a single action (e.g., "update my resume"), whereas a goal is a broader objective achieved over time (e.g., "secure an internship in my field").
Career Choice Factors: I evaluated how work roles, location, salary, and workplace environment impact long-term satisfaction.

How to set goals:
- Write down your goal (specific and measurable).
- Share it with others for accountability.
- Create an action plan (break it into smaller steps).
- Review progress (e.g., after six months) and adjust as needed.

**Result:**
This exercise helped me clarify my career aspirations and develop a structured approach to setting and achieving professional goals. I now better understand how to align my interests with practical considerations when planning my future goal of working in software testing.

**Situation:**
To prepare for my second-semester work studies, I completed the Skills and Interests module, which focused on self-assessment and aligning personal strengths with workplace expectations.

**Task:**
The assignment required me to:

- Reflect on my core values and how they shape my professional identity.
- Identify skills valued by employers and compare them to my own abilities.
- Determine my top values and key skills to better understand my fit in the workplace.

**Action:**

Through this exercise, I:

1. Core Values: Recognized that honesty, integrity, respect, accountability, and collaboration guide my decisions and interactions.
1. Employer Needs: Researched and noted that companies prioritize organized, dependable, communicative, hardworking, and reliable employees.
1. Self-Assessment:
Top Personal Values: Kindness, honesty, organization, self-motivation, and integrity.
1. My Skills:
Interpersonal: Kindness, teamwork, leadership.
Professional: Hardworking, dependable, strong communication.
Connecting Values to Skills: integrity, accountability.

**Result:**
By completing the Skills and Interests topic and quizzes, I now have a clearer understanding of:

- How my values align with workplace expectations.
- Where my strengths (e.g., communication, leadership) can contribute to a team.
- Areas to highlight in future applications or interviews.

This reflection has better prepared me to articulate my skills and adapt to professional environments during work studies.
